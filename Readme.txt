Small story-based D&D game, c++ window desktop application 64bit. Raylib library

The game lore is based on the Innistrad universe, and it is where Ether journeys to save his younger sister Clarabella.

The game project started as a c++ console assignment for my computer science 1 class (COS1030),
which became a small game app using SFML library, and into a personal project using the Raylib library.

Project description:

Ether’s Quest is a small story-based “D&D game” based on the Innistrad universe. 
Where Ether journeys to save his younger sister Clarabella. 
Clarabella was abducted by the evil vampire lord, Salt, 
to be offered in sacrifice to the demon Iretrat. In exchange for Clarabella’s soul, 
Iretrat will reanimate Pantra, Salt’s lost love, using Clarabella’s blood. 
The sacrifice must be performed on the first day of the Hunter’s moon, 
at the Skirsdag high temple located in Stensia. 
Ether’s journey to save Clarabella will start at his home in Gavony; 
he will travel through the region of Nephalia , Kessig, and Stensia, 
where he will encounter many dangers. Provided that he survives the journey; 
at Skirsdag high temple, he will have to battle 
and defeat both lord Salt and the demon Iretrat to save Clarabella and complete his quest.
